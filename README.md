# diesel_migrations_async

Fork of the [`diesel_migrations`](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/diesel_migrations) crate with support for the [`diesel-async`](https://github.com/weiznich/diesel_async) crate.  
Mainly intended for migrations without having to install `libpq`.

The old version history unfortunately couldn't be preserved because this fork is extracted out of the monorepo.
